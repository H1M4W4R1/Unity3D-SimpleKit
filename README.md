# Reporting issues

All issues should be reported in respective sub-repository, try to avoid duplicates by searching for existing issues
first.

# Commiting rules
You can freely request a pull request, but try to keep commits and pull-requests as small as possible
to make the review process easier and faster (also known as: I probably won't review it if it's too large).
